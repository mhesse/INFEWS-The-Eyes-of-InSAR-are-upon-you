% Satellite Missions
In order to better observe freshwater resources, recent satellite missions have provided massive amounts of data, such as precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, surface soil moisture from the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission, total water storage change from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and the GRACE Follow-on (GRACE-FO) mission. In particular, surface deformation data derived from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) (1992-present) can be used for characterizing groundwater levels and storage properties in confined aquifers, the critical metric needed for effective groundwater management. While spaceborne Earth-observing missions have provided large amounts of data that can be used to study freshwater resources, these data have been greatly under-utilized in operational water management practices. A grand challenge we need to address today is how to assimilate satellite and in-situ data into quantitative, predictive and computational groundwater models to better assist decision making.

The Rio Grande Decision Support System (RGDSS) is a MODFLOW model of the SLV that is used to predict head levels in the confined aquifer  .  Head data over the active area of water use are sparse in 1978, but grow more robust to the present although the monitoring data points are unequally distributed . The lack of historical and well-distributed head data impacts the accuracy of the modeling.  There is great interest in the ability to assimilate satellite and in-situ data into quantitative, predictive and computational groundwater flow models to better assist decision making.

Currently, the Rio Grand Decision Support System (RGDSS), which includes a hydrogeologic database and a MODFLOW finite-difference groundwater flow model, 

The conceptual RGDSS hydrogeologic model of the SLV consists of five distinct hydrogeologic layers \citep{RGDSS}. 


\subsubsection{Water Balance Model}
Understanding the availability of freshwater resources requires measurement of key components in the freshwater cycle shown in Figure \ref{fig:watercycle}. Here we consider the surface water and boundary layer as a single element, denoted surface water. The net freshwater fluxes can be approximated by the following equation:
\begin{align}
\Delta SM +\Delta S^s +\Delta S^u + \Delta S^c = P-ET-Q
\label{eq:waterBalance}  
\end{align}
where $P$ is precipitation, $ET$ is evapotranspiration, $Q$ is the river runoff. $\Delta SM$ is the change in soil moisture, $\Delta S^s$ is the change in surface water storage in rivers and lakes, $\Delta S^u$ is the change in unconfined aquifer storage, and $\Delta S^c$  is the change in confined aquifer storage.

\begin{figure}

\label{fig:watercycle}
\end{figure}

The change in confined aquifer storage $\Delta S^c$ can be further expressed as:
\begin{align}
\Delta S^c = R - W
\label{eq:confinedStorage}  
\end{align}
where $W$ is the withdrawal from the confined aquifer and R is the recharge. Given a \textcolor{red}{minimum safe storage level for the confined aquifer} $\Delta S^{C-min}$, we can manage the storage of the confined aquifer by scheduling withdrawals such that withdrawal ceases when (in our convention withdrawal leads to negative $\Delta S^c$):
\begin{align}
\Delta S^c = P-ET-Q-\Delta SM - \Delta S^s - \Delta S^u = R-W < \Delta S^{C-min}
\label{eq:safelimit}  
\end{align}
Note that $\Delta S^c$  can be considered as a source term describing the forcing of water into the confined aquifer.  We therefore introduce an additional notation to emphasize its role as a source and its explicit dependence on both space and time:
\begin{align}
U(x;t) = \Delta S^c
\label{eq:force}  
\end{align}

\end{figure}

We have employed land subsidence measurements derived from InSAR to estimate the skeletal storage coefficient of the confined aquifer
\begin{align}
  S_{k} = \frac{\Delta b}{\Delta h}
\label{eq:elastic}  
\end{align}
from total change in surface elevation, $\Delta b$, due to GW extraction (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prelim insar}\emph{a}) and the change in head levels, $\Delta h$. This provides point estimates of $S_k$ at the monitoring wells.

% Due to the lack of direct observations, the water storage change in deep confined aquifers is the least well-characterized element in the fresh water cycle. Land subsidence measurements derived from InSAR can be employed to improve the temporal and spatial resolution of existing confined aquifer well data sets, because the total compaction $\Delta b$ due to confined aquifer pumping is proportional to the change in head levels known as hydraulic head $\Delta h$ as \citep[e.g.,][]{galloway2011}:

% where the skeletal storage coefficient $S_{k}$ can be either elastic or inelastic. When the head is maintained above the historical low, known as the preconsolidation head, the aquifer and aquitard deform elastically. When the head drops below the preconsolidation head, additional inelastic deformation occurs in clay units. Inelastic deformation is irreversible, which leads to permanent aquifer storage loss. 

% In addition, there are differences in the timing of deformation, in particular relative to the timing of head change. In order to convert InSAR subsidence to changes in head, the values of $S_{k}$  and the time delay at every location of interest are needed. These parameters can be estimated from co-located head and subsidence data \citep{Chen2016}. Assuming that the aquifer storage properties vary slowly in space, we can interpolate the $S_{k}$ and the time delay values at known locations in order to improve the spatial coverage of the existing hydraulic head dataset using InSAR \citep{Chen2017}.
